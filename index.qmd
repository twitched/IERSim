## IER Simulation

This is a set of pages that run through simulating and testing data for the CMV IER project by Elizabeth Raglund, Christie Fuller, Marcia Simmering, and Doug Twitchell.

## Generate Baseline Data

In this simulation, we generate a data set with no IER. This is the baseline data set that we will use to compare to the other data sets.
